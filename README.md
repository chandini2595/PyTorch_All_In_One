# PyTorch_All_In_One
It is completely interview related. I'm preparing and noting down here

1. Pytorch - Facebook product - uses dynamic graphs that is rebuilt everytime - takes time to rebuild graph
2. Tensorflow - Google - static graphs - create and connect variables at beginning - not for NLP
3. Here is an possible list of steps to implement a deep learning pipeline:
    - Download the dataset
    - Load and preprocess the dataset
    - Define the model
    - Define the loss function and optimizer
    - Define the evaluation metric
    - Train the network on the training data
    - Report results on the train and test data
4. Tensors
